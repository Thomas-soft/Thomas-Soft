# Hi, I'm [Your Name] üëã

I‚Äôm a student at 42, passionate about **programming**, **artificial intelligence**, and **building digital products**. Currently, I‚Äôm focused on developing **micro-SaaS** products and integrating **no-code** tools to create simple, efficient solutions powered by AI.

## üöÄ What I Do

- Learning and experimenting with **no-code tools** like **Bubble**, **Webflow**, **Zapier**, etc.
- Exploring the possibilities of **AI** (primarily with **OpenAI GPT-4**) to build useful, automated applications.
- Getting experience with **back-end and front-end development** (using languages like **Python**, **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS**).
- Working on personal projects to gain experience and create **micro-SaaS** products using simple, accessible technologies.
