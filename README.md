# Hi, I'm Thomas Soft!

## ü§ñ Automation & Web Scraping Specialist

I build intelligent solutions in Python to automate tasks, scrape websites, and store data in CSV files. Passionate about stealth techniques, I leverage tools like undetected-chromedriver, PyAutoGUI, and more to ensure my automation remains undetectable. I also integrate language models (LLMs) to enhance data extraction and analysis workflows.
